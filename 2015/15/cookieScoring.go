package main

// Hardcode all the ingredients (as a struct) --> dont hardcode just read in the input
// make a cookie which can hold the ingredients
// make a function which calculates the score which takes a channel
// do a for for for for loop which gives all the possible combinations up to 100 --> can we generalize this?
// fire the function with the cookie channel
// check the output of the channel for score - save the highest scoring.
